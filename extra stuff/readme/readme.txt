Some Assumption:

1)CSV file which is going to be imported should be seperated by only  ','   ,not by any other character.

2)Login Information
	
  User Name:admin	
  Password :admin

3)For automatic email sending, I used windows task scheduler locally.By using task scheduler I am able to send automatically emails. 

However You also can check manually by following steps:
These  php files are my email sending files:appointmentreminder.php, birthdaywish.php , feedback.php , announcement.php
You can manually check by typing this url : http://localhost/UHS/appointmentreminder.php(for appointment reminder).
					    http://localhost/UHS/birthdaywish.php(for birthday wish).
					    http://localhost/UHS/feedback.php (for feedback).
					    http://localhost/UHS/announcement.php (for announcement).
